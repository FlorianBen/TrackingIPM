# Samples directory

Samples directory contains several examples of usage of the SpaceCharge library.

## Sample 001 (OLD, rework foreseen)
This sample program computes the electrical field of a bunch along one axis for several times positions.
It uses old API function for saving data and should be reworked.

## Sample 002 (Clean foreseen)
This sample program computes the trajectory of a particle within an EM field (Static electrical field from COMSOL).

## Sample 003
This sample program computes the trajectory of a particle within an EM field (Beam field).

## Sample 004
This sample program computes the field across a map of coordinates by using interpolation. The source of the field can be from file, computed or any object that implements Field functions. Similar to sample 005.

## Sample 005
This sample program computes the field across a map of coordinates by using interpolation. The source of the field can be from file, computed or any object that implements Field functions. Similar to sample 004.

## Sample 006 (Missing)

## Sample 007 (WIP)
This sample computes the field induced by a Gaussian beam by means of FEM.

## Sample 008 (DONE)
This sample computes the sensitive potentials and fields of strips on a readout according to the Ramo-Shockley theorem.
The potentials and fields are exported in the HDF5 format.

## Sample 007 (WIP)
This sample computes the current induced by a particle on several strips. This is a combination of sample 3 and 8.
