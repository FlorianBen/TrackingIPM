# Sample 001
This sample program computes the electrical field of a bunch along one axis for several times positions.
It uses old API function for saving data and should be reworked.

# Sample 002
This sample program computes the trajectory of a particle within an EM field (Static electrical field from COMSOL).

# Sample 003
This sample program computes the trajectory of a particle within an EM field (Beam field).

# Sample 004
This sample program computes the field across a map of coordinates.
